"""Startup schema migrations.

Runs in PUBobot2.py AFTER database.db.connect() and BEFORE `import bot`. That
ordering is load-bearing: every bot package declares its tables via
db.ensure_table() at import time, and ensure_table CREATEs any name it does not
find — so a rename that has not happened yet would strand the old table and
spawn an empty new one. Renaming first lets the updated declarations find the
renamed tables.

Every migration is idempotent by construction (existence guards), and the
schema_migrations ledger additionally records what ran, so seeds and drops
execute exactly once. The prod DB is only ever written from inside the deployed
bot — this module is that write path; never run it from a laptop.

For future migration authors: MySQL DDL auto-commits, and there is no
transaction wrapping a migration body together with its ledger write. If a
migration dies partway through, everything it already executed is permanent,
and the next boot re-runs the whole body from the top. That means every single
statement inside a migration body must be individually idempotent on its own —
guarded by `table_exists`/`column_exists` (as `rename_table`/`rename_column`
already do) or written as `IF EXISTS`/`INSERT IGNORE` — not just the migration
as a whole. Do not rely on the ledger to make a half-applied body safe to
re-run; the ledger only records success after the entire body returns.
