"""Startup schema migrations.

Runs in PUBobot2.py AFTER database.db.connect() and BEFORE `import bot`. That
ordering is load-bearing: every bot package declares its tables via
db.ensure_table() at import time, and ensure_table CREATEs any name it does not
find — so a rename that has not happened yet would strand the old table and
spawn an empty new one. Renaming first lets the updated declarations find the
renamed tables.

Every migration is idempotent by construction (existence guards), and the
schema_migrations ledger additionally records what ran, so seeds and drops
execute exactly once. The prod DB is only ever written from inside the deployed
bot — this module is that write path; never run it from a laptop.
